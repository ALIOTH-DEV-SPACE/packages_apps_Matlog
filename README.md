Overview
---------
MatLog is a free and open-source material-style log reader for Android based on CatLog.

It shows a scrolling (tailed) view of the Android "logcat" system log, 
hence the goofy name.  It also allows you to record logs in real time, send logs via email, 
and filter using a variety of criteria.

FAQs
-------------
Taken from CatLog's FAQ:

#### Where are the logs saved?

On the SD card, under ```/sdcard/catlog/saved_logs/```.

#### I can't see any logs!

This problem typically shows up on custom ROMs.  First off, try an alternative logging app, to verify that
the problem is with your ROM and not CatLog.

Next, see if your ROM offers system-wide settings to disable logging.  Be sure to reboot after you change anything.

If that still doesn't work, you can contact the creator of your ROM to file a bug/RFE.
