MatLog
=========
It's CatLog, but with material goodness.

Graphical log reader for Android.

Based on Nolan Lawson's CatLog: [Google Play][1], [GitHub][2]

Overview
---------
MatLog is a free and open-source material-style log reader for Android based on CatLog.

It shows a scrolling (tailed) view of the Android "logcat" system log, 
hence the goofy name.  It also allows you to record logs in real time, send logs via email, 
and filter using a variety of criteria.

Download
--------------
MatLog is currently in beta. If you would like to help test the app, please join the [Google+ 
community here][3] and click on the link for beta testing there. APKs are also published
on the [releases][4] page.

FAQs
-------------
Taken from CatLog's FAQ:

#### Where are the logs saved?

On the SD card, under ```/sdcard/catlog/saved_logs/```.

#### I can't see any logs!

This problem typically shows up on custom ROMs.  First off, try an alternative logging app, to verify that
the problem is with your ROM and not CatLog.

Next, see if your ROM offers system-wide settings to disable logging.  Be sure to reboot after you change anything.

If that still doesn't work, you can contact the creator of your ROM to file a bug/RFE.

Requires root on Android 4.1+
